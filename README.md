# ðŸ›’ Sales Prediction Regression Model Deployment in Machine Learning with Python

This project applies a machine learning regression approach using XGBoost to forecast daily product sales. After training and evaluating the model, it is deployed using Streamlit to provide an accessible prediction interface for end users.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **XGBoost Regression Model**  
  Trained to predict `number_sold` using historical inputs.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- **Streamlit Web Deployment**  
  Interactive UI for real-time prediction and input customization.
